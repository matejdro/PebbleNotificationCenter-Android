	Additional data:
		1 = Next or previous (1 = Next, -1 = Previous) - int8
	
	Packet 9 - Dismiss ACK (ACK for Phone->Pebble packet 4)
		 2 = Close app after receiving this packet. If this key is present, pebble app will be closed (also see Packet 7) - uint8
				
Phone --> Pebble

	Packet 0 - New notification packet
	Phone sends it to display notification.
	Additional data:
		1 = Unique notification id (int32)
